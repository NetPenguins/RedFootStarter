        <p>
            <strong>Apex Predator Alert</strong> was created to assist in the reporting and identification 
            of wildlife that can pose a threat to life and property. We aim to educate the 
            public on the dangers of certain predators in the wild and establish a healthy 
            understanding as to why such wildlife might attack. The most important thing to 
            remember is that we have encroached on their land torn down <strong>their</strong> homes and 
            driven them out of <strong>their</strong> habitats in which they have grown and evolved over 
            thousand/millions of years. This devastating action by humanity has been further 
            exasperated as we continue to develop our communities in the ashes of what was 
            rightfully <strong>theirs</strong>. When we find a mountain lion in our back yard it is not 
            because they want to hurt you or your pets, it is because we have built our 
            homes on top of their previous home. We have put our resources over theirs 
            and they are simply trying to survive. When they feel threatened, they will defend 
            themselves the same way we defend ourselves. Please do not fear the wildlife you 
            have built your life around but rather embrace the opportunity to live alongside 
            them providing them the opportunity to grow and prosper in a world that is unlike 
            their previously known world. Use this system to establish a social network of 
            understanding, if your neighbor reports they saw a bear in the area simply make 
            the accommodation to be more cautious about your animals and yourself routines 
            rather than hunt down an innocent animal simply trying to live on the land we have taken from them.
